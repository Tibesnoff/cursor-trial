# Quantum Clicker - An Incremental Space Adventure

## Game Concept

**Quantum Clicker** is an incremental clicker game set in a futuristic space exploration theme. Players start as a lone space explorer with a basic energy collector, gradually building up their cosmic empire through strategic resource management, worker allocation, and technological advancement.

## Current Game Features

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Click to Collect**: Players click to harvest quantum energy, the primary resource
2. **Automate Production**: Purchase automated collectors and facilities to generate resources passively
3. **Hire Workers**: Recruit different types of workers to boost building efficiency
4. **Build Infrastructure**: Construct various facilities across four categories
5. **Manage Resources**: Balance energy, crystals, research data, and defense points

### Resource System

The game features four distinct resources:

- **⚡ Quantum Energy**: Primary currency earned by clicking and energy-producing buildings
- **💎 Quantum Crystals**: Secondary resource from material-producing buildings
- **🧪 Research Data**: Generated by research facilities, required for defense buildings
- **🛡️ Defense Points**: Produced by defense infrastructure (currently not used for purchases)

- **Communication Array**: Cross-reality communication (20000 ⚡ + 500 💎 + 200 🧪)

### Worker System

Six different worker types provide production bonuses to buildings:

- **👷 Engineers**: Boost energy and material production
- **🔬 Scientists**: Enhance research and material facilities
- **📊 Researchers**: Improve research and energy buildings
- **🏗️ Architects**: Optimize advanced facilities
- **⚙️ Technicians**: Support material and defense systems
- **🎮 Operators**: Manage defense and research infrastructure

### Building Management

- **Individual Building Modals**: Click any building card to open detailed management
- **Production Modifiers**: Multiple buildings of the same type act as production multipliers
- **Worker Recommendations**: Each building shows recommended worker types
- **Cost Scaling**: Building costs increase exponentially with each purchase

### Upgrade System

- **Click Power**: Increases energy gained per click
- **Collector Efficiency**: Boosts all energy-producing buildings

### Statistics & Progress Tracking

- **Total Clicks**: Lifetime click count
- **Total Energy Earned**: Cumulative energy production
- **Play Time**: Active gameplay duration
- **Building Counts**: Number of each building type owned
- **Worker Counts**: Number of each worker type hired
- **Production Rates**: Current per-second resource generation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development

- **Crystals**: Secondary resource, required for advanced buildings
- **Research**: Specialized resource, only needed for defense infrastructure
- **Defense**: Currently produced but not consumed (future use planned)

### Strategic Depth
- **Worker Allocation**: Players must balance worker types for optimal production
- **Building Priorities**: Different resource requirements create meaningful choices
- **Cost Scaling**: Exponential costs encourage strategic planning
- **Production Synergy**: Buildings work together to create efficient production chains

This incremental clicker provides a solid foundation for engaging gameplay with room for significant expansion and feature additions over time.
